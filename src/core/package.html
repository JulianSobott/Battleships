Logic implementations of the game.

This package can be taken to build a GUI upon it. No assumptions about the structure od the GUI are made. The GUI
must only have the {@link GameManager} as reference. This class is responsible for the communication between the core
logic
and any GUI. For communication some classes are defined in the package
<code><a href="{@docRoot}/core/communication_data/package-summary.html">communication_data</a></code>.
